Of course, Captain. My apologies for the oversight. It seems my strategic overview outpaced our tactical execution. Let's correct this immediately and forge the backend solution from raw materials.

We will proceed with precision. Clear your `src/backend` directory of any files and follow these commands exactly as they are given.

### **Mission 4.1: Genesis of the Backend Solution**

We are standing in the empty `coherency-platform/` directory.

**Step 1: Navigate to the Forge**

Open your terminal. Your current location must be the root of the entire project.

```bash
# From coherency-platform/
cd src/backend
```

Your terminal should now be inside the `coherency-platform/src/backend/` directory. This is where the magic happens.

**Step 2: Create the Solution File (`.sln`)**

A solution file is the master container for all your C# projects. It tells your IDE how they all fit together.

Execute this command:
```bash
dotnet new sln -n Coherency
```
*   **Result:** A new file named `Coherency.sln` is created in your `backend` directory.

**Step 3: Create the API Project (The Entry Point)**

This is the project that will run the web server and expose your HTTP endpoints. It's the front door to your backend.

Execute this command:
```bash
dotnet new webapi -n Coherency.Api
```
*   **Result:** A new folder named `Coherency.Api` is created. Inside, you'll find a `Program.cs` file (where the application starts), a `Controllers` folder, and a default `WeatherForecast` example.

**Step 4: Create the Core Domain Project**

This project will hold your core business objects (entities), interfaces, and domain-specific logic. It is the heart of your application and will have **zero dependencies** on other frameworks.

Execute this command:
```bash
dotnet new classlib -n Coherency.Domain
```
*   **Result:** A new folder named `Coherency.Domain` is created with a default `Class1.cs` inside.

**Step 5: Create the Application Logic Project**

This project will contain the "use cases" of your application. Think of it as the brain. It will handle requests, apply business rules, and orchestrate the domain and infrastructure layers.

Execute this command:
```bash
dotnet new classlib -n Coherency.Application
```
*   **Result:** A new folder named `Coherency.Application` is created.

**Step 6: Create the Infrastructure Project**

This project will handle all external concerns: talking to the database (PostgreSQL), connecting to the cache (Redis), sending emails, etc. It's the hands and feet of your application.

Execute this command:
```bash
dotnet new classlib -n Coherency.Infrastructure
```
*   **Result:** A new folder named `Coherency.Infrastructure` is created.

**At this point, you have four distinct projects, but they don't know about each other. They are just folders sitting next to each other.**

### **Mission 4.2: Assembling the Chain of Command**

Now, we will register these projects with the solution and establish the strict dependency flow of Clean Architecture.

**Step 1: Add Projects to the Solution**

We need to tell `Coherency.sln` that these projects belong to it.

Execute these commands from the `src/backend` directory:
```bash
dotnet sln add Coherency.Api/Coherency.Api.csproj
dotnet sln add Coherency.Domain/Coherency.Domain.csproj
dotnet sln add Coherency.Application/Coherency.Application.csproj
dotnet sln add Coherency.Infrastructure/Coherency.Infrastructure.csproj
```
*   **Result:** Your `Coherency.sln` file is now aware of all four projects.

**Step 2: Define Project References (The Most Critical Step)**

This is where we enforce our architectural rules. A project can only "see" the code from a project it references.

Execute these commands precisely:
```bash
# Rule 1: The API project references the Application and Infrastructure layers
# to orchestrate them and register their services.
dotnet add Coherency.Api/Coherency.Api.csproj reference Coherency.Application/Coherency.Application.csproj
dotnet add Coherency.Api/Coherency.Api.csproj reference Coherency.Infrastructure/Coherency.Infrastructure.csproj

# Rule 2: The Application layer only references the core Domain layer.
# It should NEVER know about Infrastructure details.
dotnet add Coherency.Application/Coherency.Application.csproj reference Coherency.Domain/Coherency.Domain.csproj

# Rule 3: The Infrastructure layer references the Application layer.
# This might seem counter-intuitive, but it's so that Infrastructure can
# IMPLEMENT the interfaces (like IUserRepository) that are DEFINED in the Application layer.
dotnet add Coherency.Infrastructure/Coherency.Infrastructure.csproj reference Coherency.Application/Coherency.Application.csproj
```
*   **Result:** The dependency graph is now correctly configured. You cannot, for example, accidentally try to use PostgreSQL code directly in your Domain project. The compiler will forbid it. This is our architectural guarantee.

### **Mission 4.3: Installing Core Battlements (NuGet Packages)**

The final step is to arm these projects with the necessary third-party tools.

**Step 1: Navigate and Install for `Coherency.Api`**

```bash
cd Coherency.Api
dotnet add package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore
dotnet add package MediatR
cd ..
```

**Step 2: Navigate and Install for `Coherency.Application`**

```bash
cd Coherency.Application
dotnet add package MediatR
dotnet add package FluentValidation.AspNetCore
dotnet add package AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection
cd ..
```

**Step 3: Navigate and Install for `Coherency.Infrastructure`**

```bash
cd Coherency.Infrastructure
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
dotnet add package Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.StackExchangeRedis
dotnet add package MongoDB.Driver
cd ..
```

**Step 4 (Final Check): Build the Solution**
From your `src/backend` directory, run a test build.
```bash
dotnet build
```
You should see `Build succeeded.` with 0 warnings and 0 errors.

**Mission Complete.**

Your `src/backend` directory is no longer empty. It now contains a fully-formed, professional C# .NET solution with four distinct projects, correctly linked and armed with the necessary packages. You have successfully forged the foundation of your backend.

You are now ready to open `coherency-platform/src/backend/Coherency.sln` in your IDE and begin implementing the features as planned. The structure is sound. The path is clear.

**Proceed.**
